      <p class="determinationFont sizeTheFonts">
        <strong>Undertale: Judgemental Justice</strong> is an Undertale fangame developed by myself and another friend of mine, and it centers around the Merciless route of UNDERTALE, adding a custom character to help out the route's final boss. It has new mechanics, SOUL modes (will dwelve into later), and custom endings based on your choices.
        This consists of two new opponents: <span class="sansFont"><strong> sans the skeleton [the final boss of the merciless route], </strong></span> and a new, custom character created by said friend that worked on this: <strong>Dave the Hybrid.</strong>

        <h2 class="determinationFont"> <strong>SANS [SKELETON]</strong></h2>
        <img id="sansWidthHeight" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/1c54905a-4836-46e9-a03d-4344d5ced512/Sans_battle_idle.gif?v=1744646018958">
        <span class="sansFont sizeTheFonts">heya. i'm sans, sans the skeleton. you're probably wondering why i'm speaking to you, even though you already know who i am. i just felt like it to be honest. so, like i said, i'm sans, sans the skeleton. i'm just a normal skeleton who just wants to chill. however, if you were to mess with my little brother, say, kill him, you will have a bad time. that's all, i'll see you later, player.</span>

       <h2 class="determinationFont"> <strong>DAVE [HYBRID]</strong></h2>
        <img id="daveWidthHeight" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/1c54905a-4836-46e9-a03d-4344d5ced512/DaveUndertale.png?v=1744647402901">
        <span class="determinationFont sizeTheFonts">Dave is what humans and monsters call, a hybrid. He is the last of its kind as all of his ancestors were killed off during the war between humans and monsters. Since he is a boss monster and he had a child that died, he's stuck at the age he is until he dies. He teams up with sans in the merciless route to help take down the human at all costs, as they believe the human will not only kill them, but other humans as well.</span>

        <h2 class="determinationFont"> <strong>RED SOUL: </strong></h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/1c54905a-4836-46e9-a03d-4344d5ced512/redSoulShowcase.gif?v=1744641631072">
        <span class="sansFont sizeTheFonts">The Red Soul is the most primarly used SOUL type in all of UNDERTALE and its fangames. In this take of an Undertale Fangame, I've added a new ability to the SOUL; The Dash Mechanic.
          This does what you expect. By pressing the [A] key, you'll zoom past the bullet board and if done correctly, you'll zoom through <strong>some</strong> attacks. Some attack are entirely undashable, leaving you to have to zoom for you life away from the attack.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 class="determinationFont"> <strong>BLUE SOUL: </strong></h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/1c54905a-4836-46e9-a03d-4344d5ced512/blueSoulShowcase.gif?v=1744641627157">
      <span class="sansFont sizeTheFonts">The Blue Soul is affected by gravity. Like the Red SOUL, the blue soul also has a dash, and it spins while the dash button is pressed. It is the same button as the Red SOUL.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 class="determinationFont"> <strong>YELLOW SOUL: </strong></h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/1c54905a-4836-46e9-a03d-4344d5ced512/yellowSoulShowcase.gif?v=1744641621696">
      <span class="sansFont sizeTheFonts">The Yellow SOUL has the same abilities as the Red SOUL, but there is a varying difference in the SOUL. It has the ability to shoot projectiles.
      By pressing the [S] key, a yellow like projectile will be shot out. There are two other varients of this soul other than the one shown. There is one to its side like DELTARUNE,
      and another one that is the flipped version of the DELTAARUNE version</span>
        <h2 class="determinationFont"> <strong>BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!</strong></h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/1c54905a-4836-46e9-a03d-4344d5ced512/yellowSoulBigShotShowcase.gif?v=1744641616748">
        <span class="sansFont sizeTheFonts"> By holding the shoot button, you'll be able to launch a big blast, known as a [BIG SHOT] It is a powerful bullet that can cut through normal projectiles and can heavily damage huge objects. Please note that by firing a big shot, there will be a cooldown [unspecified length] after you shoot the bullet.</span>
